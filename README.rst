Spyglass Excel Plugin
---------------------

Tugboat is a Spyglass plugin to generate airship-seaworthy site manifest files
from an excel based engineering spec. The plugin is configured with an Excel
sheet and its corresponding excel specification as inputs. Spyglass uses this
plugin to construct an intermediary yaml which is processed further using J2
templates to generate site manifests.
